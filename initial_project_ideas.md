# Project Ideas

I have listed three project ideas for capstone 1 project. They are ordered 

1. Crypto Exchange Fees in USA
   - Problem: Top crypto exchanges in the USA like Coinbase and Gemini don't share on their website the fees they charge for withdrawing crypto from the exchange. This prevents potential users from knowing how much they will be paying to buy and widraw a crypto currency from those exchanges. Also, right now you have go to each individual crypto exchange website to view theirs fee and then compare them.
   - Solution: Make a webpage that display the current crypto widdraw fees for all coins offered that user would pay when witdrawing from three crypto exchanges: Coinbase, Gemini, and Kraken. Will have a table that displays by coin and another table that displays by exchanges. Will have a search bar that allows user to search for coins. This will make easier to view and compare the withdrawl fees for all the crypto exchanges listed. Extra feature would be to have a calculator that calculates how much a user will pay in fees for buying a certain amount of a crypto currency and then withdrawing that crypto. Will be using the Coinbase, Gemini, and Kraken API's.

2. Global Streaming Search for Movies and TV Shows
   - Problem: Current global streaming seach websites don't display easiy the availablility of movies and shows in other countries
   - Solution: WIll display the title searched and what streaming platform is the available to stream on for the following countries: US, Canada, UK, Australia, and Brazil. Will use the Watchmode API. There is also unogsNG API, unofficial Netflix Online Global Search, Search all netflix regions in one place. ANother project idea can be to do only Netflix, but for all countries and have a better UI than current unogsNG.
