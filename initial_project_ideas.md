# Project Ideas

I have listed three project ideas for capstone 1 project. I am leaning towards working on idea 1 for capstone.

1. Crypto Exchange Fees in USA
   - Problem: Top crypto exchanges in the USA like Coinbase and Gemini don't share on their website the fees they charge for withdrawing crypto from the exchange. This prevents potential users from knowing how much they will be paying to buy and withdraw crypto currency from those exchanges. Also, right now you have to go to each individual crypto exchange website to view their fees and then compare them.
   - Solution: Make a webpage that displays the current crypto withdrawal fees for all coins offered that users would pay when withdrawing from three crypto exchanges: Coinbase, Gemini, and Kraken. Will have a table that displays by coin and another table that displays by exchanges. Will have a search bar that allows user to search for coins. This will make it easier to view and compare the withdrawal fees for all the crypto exchanges listed. Extra feature would be to have a calculator that calculates how much a user will pay in fees for buying a certain amount of a crypto currency and then withdrawing that crypto. Will be using the Coinbase, Gemini, and Kraken API's.

2. Global Streaming Search for Movies and Shows
   - Problem: Current global streaming search websites don't display easily the availability of movies and shows on streaming platforms in other countries. Also, these websites are cluttered and makes it harder to find the streaming availability of movies and shows in different countries.
   - Solution: Make a webpage that displays the searched movie or show title details and what streaming platform it is available on and for what countries. Will use the Watchmode API, which will provide streaming sources for the following countries: US, Canada, UK, Australia, and Brazil. Extra feature can be to randomly select a show or movie for the user. This would be for people who don't know what to watch. Will have filtering options so users can narrow the random movie or show selection to their preference

3. Netflix Global Search
   - Problem: All unofficial netflix global search websites that I have seen have simple web designs. These sites don't easily display the list of countries that the movie or show is available in.
   - Solution: Design a new netflix global search website that uses the uNoGS API that displays search results of movies and shows. In the search result, users would easily identify a list of countries that the content is available in for Netflix. Extra feature can be to randomly select a show or movie for the user. This would be for people who don't know what to watch. Will have filtering options so users can narrow the random movie or show selection to their preference.
