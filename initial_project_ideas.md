# Project Ideas

I have listed three project ideas for capstone 1 project. I am leaning towards working on idea 1 for capstone.

1. Crypto Exchange Fees in USA
   - Problem: Top crypto exchanges in the USA like Coinbase and Gemini don't share on their website the fees they charge for withdrawing crypto from the exchange. This prevents potential users from knowing how much they will be paying to buy and widraw a crypto currency from those exchanges. Also, right now you have go to each individual crypto exchange website to view theirs fee and then compare them.
   - Solution: Make a webpage that display the current crypto widdraw fees for all coins offered that user would pay when witdrawing from three crypto exchanges: Coinbase, Gemini, and Kraken. Will have a table that displays by coin and another table that displays by exchanges. Will have a search bar that allows user to search for coins. This will make easier to view and compare the withdrawl fees for all the crypto exchanges listed. Extra feature would be to have a calculator that calculates how much a user will pay in fees for buying a certain amount of a crypto currency and then withdrawing that crypto. Will be using the Coinbase, Gemini, and Kraken API's.

2. Global Streaming Search for Movies and Shows
   - Problem: Current global streaming seach websites don't display easiy the availablility of movies and shows on streaming platforms in other countries. Also, these websites are clutered and makes it harder to find the streaming availablitliy of movies and shows in different countries.
   - Solution: Make a webpage that displays the title searched and what streaming platform it is available on and for what countrieson. Will use the Watchmode API, which will provide streeaming sources for the following countries: US, Canada, UK, Australia, and Brazil. Extra feature can to randomly select a show or movie for you. This would be for people who don't know what to watch. Will have filtering options so users can narrow the random movie or show selection to their preference.

3. Netflix Global Search
   - Problem: All unoffical netflix global search websites that I have seen have a simple web designs. These sites doesn't easily display the list of countries that the movie or show is available in.
   - Solution: Design a new netflix global search website that uses the uNoGS API that display search results of movies and shows. In the search result, users wuould easilty identify a list of countries that the content is availble in for Netflix.
